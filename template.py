1. "Thanks Ben, Points duly noted, I will chat to the other field team members to see how they feel about it also so we can make a decision. Will be in touch."
2. "Hi Les, Great to chat today, sorry for the belated email, itâ€™s been a busy day.  Just wanted to shoot you the resumeâ€™s for Josh and Steve for your perusal. As per conversation with you today we have an Auto Sparky looking to broaden his knowledge and work on the larger gear but also wanting to be in town as he has a young family. Josh is a great guy, great team player, has a positive attitude and is reliable. Josh does struggle with a few parts of his electrical trade mainly being the diagnosing of electrical faults and air conditioning, so in the equipment assembly space will be a good start for him to continue his journey in the trade and gain that experience.  We are happy to lock in a rate of 90 per hour for Josh. As mentioned we have a really good guy by the name of Steve too, grew up on a farm out of Rockhampton and still lives there and been around mechanical work since he was 13.  Loves mechanical and also very good at Auto Electrical and fabrication work as well.  He is super keen to get into mining and grow his skillset and increase his trade knowledge.  He was recommended by one of our long-term employees who also rate him as a person and worker.   Steveâ€™s trade certificate although being motorcycle mechanical technology doesnâ€™t show his mechanical aptitude and skills.  He spent 2 x years at the New Holland dealership working on tractors and machinery plus contracts to another company fixing their trucks, small loaders and diggers.  The company that finally signed him off only had one tradesperson left at the time that he was being signed off so the trade of motorcycle mechanic was all he could get signed off on, he is a motor mechanic.  We are going to put Steve through his Auto Electrical trade as well. Happy if you give us a buzz Les to chat further on your thoughts mate. Thanks for your time mate."
3. "Thanks Kelli, If we can invoice as per usual that would be great, we can only try. Will see if we can get the techs to send Jobsheets through quicker.  Electronic timesheets would help that."
4. "Thanks Ben,Sounds amazing."

The feedback overall was good however only concern is the time that it takes for it to become fully usable which is concerning. Below is from Delwyn: I had to download some information for Hubby the other day and they use Sprint Suite alongside Employment Hero at De Goey Contractors. Attached is the email he had the other day with the info they provided. I just messaged Tim to see what his thoughts are as he 200 + staff everywhere He replied as below."
